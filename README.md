Create a simili reddit
First big project, 2 weeks to create the UI / the documentation (swagger / unit test / user) / the API.
Back end and Front end were built on Laravel.



## My_work

Confident in my skills and because I 'enjoyed' Laravel the first time, I decided to work the entire API creation, the DB (MySQL) and once that was done, I moved on creating the Auth system and the front-end CRUD admin interface.
